## Planning Documentation
To begin, we met up on Zoom and brainstormed project ideas. Some other ideas we considered were using different foods/products, but we settled fairly quickly on a "Cookie Clicker"-esque game and Pizza Press was a perfect alliterative phrase that fit our theme.

From there, Lingling, our frontend lead, created a rough initial design for the project on paper:

While working on the project, we made a few decisions that affected the final outcome of the project:
1. Forego automatic clicking
2. Instead of recording number of pizzas, just record amount earned
3. Change the rate at which you earn money (price per pizza) by using upgrades (toppings)
