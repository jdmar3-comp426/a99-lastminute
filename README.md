# Pizza Press
COMP426 final project template repository. All your code and documentation goes here. Change this text to be a brief description of your final project. Put the name in the header above. You will change everything below to be the main technical documentation, as outlined below.

Our final project for COMP426 was called "Pizza Press" in loving memory of the pizza restaurant that used to be on Franklin Street. It works similarly to once wildly popular mobile game "Cookie Clicker." Every time you click on the pizza button, you sell a pizza and make money! You can use the money you made to buy toppings that increase the price of your pizzas. The button tracks your current balance and total revenue. You can even compete for a spot on the leaderboard. Just press the pizza to get started!

4. Make sure that all of your team members have access to the repository as administrators.
7. Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this README.md file or in another file under `/docs/`.
8. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.

## Team mangement

Plan to meet with your team ASAP.
Talk through identifying roles within your team.

Try to figure out what each of you are good at/enjoy doing and try to work out roles that incorporate that.

Some basic roles you will want to consider:

1. A review manager - someone to review pull requests and merge or reject them and manage the related discussions
2. A plan manager - someone to keep an eye on the overall plan and keep the project tab/to-do list up to date
3. A documentation manager - someone to keep the documentation in order and identify what is missing and needs to be documented
4. Roles for team members to take charge or different parts of the project. Possible roles:
    1. Front end lead
    2. Back end lead
    3. Databse lead
    4. Design lead
    5. Etc.
